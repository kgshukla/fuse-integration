# JBoss Fuse Quick Starts

This project contains multiple Quick Starts intended for use with JBoss Fuse. These Quick starts are intended to be beginner level projects that demonstrate a single concept at a time. In some cases more Advanced Quick Starts are included that build upon the basic Quick Start to demonstrate more complex features. The quickstarts are designed to get someone started quickly with a given component and are not designed to be full solutions. Quick starts are provided for both Fuse on Karaf as well as Fuse on EAP.
